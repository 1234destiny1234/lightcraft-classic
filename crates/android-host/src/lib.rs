//! The Android app's calls into its activity, over JNI, and the activity's answers.
//!
//! The app runs as a native library inside a small Java activity (`packaging/android`, a
//! `NativeActivity` subclass). What only Java can do goes through it: the system pickers (the
//! Storage Access Framework, which hands out `content://` documents rather than paths) and opening
//! links, and the on-screen keyboard (`nativeIme`, queued for the next frame: [`take_ime`]). The activity copies picked documents into the app's own folders, so the app only ever
//! sees file paths, and watches a saved file to copy it to the document the user chose. A folder
//! or file on the device's own storage that the app may read (with "All files access") is answered
//! with its real path instead, so nothing is copied. Copies that remain report through
//! [`CopyProgress`], so the app can show them in its activity stack and stop them.
//!
//! A picker answers asynchronously: [`Host::pick`] returns a channel at once, and the activity
//! calls back into native code (`nativePicked`, registered at start-up, so no symbol depends on
//! the package name) when the user is done. The registered waker then asks the UI for a frame.
//!
//! This is one of the crates allowed `unsafe`: the `jvm` module adopts the JVM and activity
//! handles android-activity gives the app. Its API is safe. Every JNI failure, a Java exception
//! included, comes back as an [`Error`]; nothing here panics, and the native callback never lets a
//! panic cross into Java.
