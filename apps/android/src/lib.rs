//! The Android app: the shared UI ([`lcc_ui_egui::LccApp`]) and engine, started by android-activity
//! inside the Java activity in `packaging/android` (a `NativeActivity` subclass).
//!
//! Where the desktop has a home folder, this host takes the app-private folders the activity
//! knows ([`lcc_brand::set_platform_dirs`]): settings in the internal data folder, the library in
//! the external one (visible to the Files app over USB, removed with the app). Pickers and links
//! go through the activity ([`lcc_android_host::Host`]).
//!
//! Off Android the library is empty, so `cargo build --workspace` stays cheap.
